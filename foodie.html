            Its Never Too Late for brunch, and it's like getting the best of both worlds" I love breakfast food and love
            sleeping in on the weekends, so BRUNCH is the best thing ever created for people like me. Its like yes l
            love eggs, bacon, & fluffy pancakes, but I also love champagne and a total sucker for a good Bloody Mary
            early
            in the day without feeling like a total lush. So here is a few spots to check out around Salt Lake that has
            been the talk of the town.

            A great casual spot for Artisan pizza, pastas and hand crafted drinks. They emphasis on using locally
            fresh ingredients, magically created by the National Award winning Chef Brandon Price."
            I am not one to order chicken on the menu when eating out but you must try the "Pollo Matone" a brick
            oven chicken, fire roasted to crispy, tender and juicy perfection! you won't regret it.
            You will not look at your toast the same way after this savory indescribable heaven in your mouth,Salmon
            toast and Baked goat cheese served with their own in-house baked Oak bread. Pair it down with
            some handcrafted cocktails. Great quality in food, you can tell lots of love goes into every dish. Good
            vibes and amazing service! Sunday Brunch at Oakwood Fire Kitchen is a must!
