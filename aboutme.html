                Hi, I'm Julie, my friends call me Julz. I am here to influence you with great local eats one meal at
                a
                time here in my beautful home state the 801/Utah and all my travels I call food-cations. I believe
                that
                every meal can be an opportunity to explore new flavors and cultures.
                â€‹</p>
            <p> I believe food tastes better when it is cooked with love and shared, because it provides food for
                the
                soul and connects everyone together. I'm excited to share my culinary adventures with you on my food
                and
                travel blogs. I eat to taste what this world has to offer. </p>
            <p>

                "You get to share love over food, so live in gratitude for all the experience."
