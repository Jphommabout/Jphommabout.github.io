            Hi I'm Julie, my friends and family calls me Julz. Influencing you with great local eats one meal at a time
            here
            in my beautful home state of the 801-Utah and some great spots I come across during my travels.

            Trying to live my best life by sharing my passion for food, cooking, exploring new cultures, and traveling.
            I
            cook with love because it provides food for the soul and I eat to taste what this world has to offer.

            Sylvester Mcnutt III said it best...

            "You get to share love over food, so live in gratitude for all the experience"
